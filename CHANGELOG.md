# 0.6.0 | 5/8/2024

## Features

- Support running specific tests by providing a test file or directory

  - `sip test ./test/my_test.dart`
  - `sip test ./test`

- Create new `clean` command
  - Removes all `.dart_tool` and `build` directories in dart & flutter packages
  - Run `flutter clean` in flutter packages

- Increase retry time frame from 2s to 4s for `flutter pub get` command

# 0.5.1 | 5/6/2024

## Fixes

- An issue where some flutter test arguments were being duplicated

# 0.5.0 | 5/1/2024

## Breaking Changes

- Add `--no-pub` when testing Flutter packages

## Enhancements

- Update copy when testing packages to
  - Display Flutter test type
  - Display args
  - Update colors for better readability

## Features

- Speed up getting dependencies via an internal auto-retry mechanism
  - For whatever reason, dart/flutter will hang after dependencies are retrieved for a lengthy amount of time. SIP_CLI will now auto-retry if the `pub get` command has been running for too long

# 0.4.6 | 4/11/2024

- Downgrade args dependency to <2.5.0

# 0.4.5 | 4/10/2024

## Features

- Support different flutter test types to avoid clashing during tests
  - `TestWidgetsFlutterBinding`, `AutomatedTestWidgetsFlutterBinding`, `LiveTestWidgetsFlutterBinding` can be used to specify the types of tests to run and CANNOT be used together
  - SIP_CLI will create a new test file for each type of test to avoid clashing

# 0.4.4 | 3/25/2024

## Fixes

- Fix issue where tests were not run without passing an argument to the `sip test` command

# 0.4.3 | 3/18/2024

## Breaking Changes

- Remove `--ignore-lockfile-exit` flag from `sip pub get` command

# 0.4.2 | 3/15/2024

## Fixes

- Create alternative flags for the `--coverage` flags as they exist in both flutter and dart but accept different arguments
  - `--coverage` for dart is changed to `--dart-coverage`
  - `--coverage` for flutter is changed to `--flutter-coverage`

## Features

- Support running pub commands for dart or flutter packages only
- If the `--coverage` flag is provided in the `sip test` command, default values will be provided to dart and flutter
  - Dart: Coverage is enabled and sets the coverage directory to `coverage`
  - Flutter: coverage is enabled
- Add `--ignore-lockfile-exit` flag to `sip pub get` command
  - When using `--enforce-lockfile`, if the lockfile is not up to date, the command will exit with a non-zero exit code. When using `--ignore-lockfile-exit`, the command ignore the non-zero exit. Even if the lockfile is not up to date, the dependencies will still be retrieved.

## Enhancements

- Update copy for the `--version-check` flag

# 0.4.1 | 3/12/2024

## Enhancements

- Don't check for update after running `sip update`

## Breaking Changes

- Rename `.optimized_test.dart` to `.test_optimizer.dart`
  - Helps avoid unintentionally running optimized tests
- Rename `--run` to `--scope` for the `sip test watch` command
- Rename `package` to `active` for improved comprehension regarding the test scope for the `sip test watch` command

## Features

- Create a new command to clean up optimized test files `sip test clean`

- Speed up recursive search for test directories using [`glob`](https://pub.dev/packages/glob)

# 0.2.3+1 | 3/8/2024

## Fix

- Fix issue where `--no-optimize` ran each test file individually
- Fix stopwatch stamp formatting

# 0.2.2 | 3/8/2024

## Features

- Support `--no-optimize` flag in `sip test` command
- Add `--quiet` flag to silence output from `sip` commands
  - This will even silence the output from the commands being run
- Add `sip update` command
  - This will update the `sip_cli` package to the latest version

## Fix

# 0.2.1 | 3/7/2024

## Enhancements

- Print first line of command before executing when running scripts non-concurrently

# 0.2.0+1 | 3/7/2024

## Breaking Change

- Remove `--disable-concurrency` in the sip run command
  - in favor of `--no-concurrent` flag
  - This is in efforts to keep the flag names consistent
- Dropping use of `sip_console` in favor of `mason_logger`

## Features

- Update logging to be more consistent
- Add stopwatch to print statements
- Handle non-null non-string values in script definitions
  - ints & bools for example
  - Maps are not supported however

## Enhancements

- Use stream controller instead of `Future.wait` to run concurrent commands
  - Better control over commands
  - The ability to bail faster on failure
- Drop use of get_it for dependency injection
  - This was overkill ðŸ˜…
- Ensure that script exists before running with `--never-exit` flag

# 0.1.2+1 | 3/6/2024

## Features

- Add `--never-exit` flag to `sip run` command
  - This will prevent the command from ever exiting, even if a command fails
  - This is useful for running a command that will be restarted by another process
    - For example, build_runner will stop running whenever the project's dependencies change
  - Please use with Caution! There is a second delay between each command run to prevent a runaway process
  - The process can be stopped by pressing `ctrl+c`

# 0.1.1 | 3/5/2024
